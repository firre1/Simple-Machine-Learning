# Machine Learning Algorithms: ID3 Decision Tree & K-Means Clustering

This project implements two fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch in Python:

1. **ID3 Decision Tree** – used for classification.
2. **K-Means Clustering** – used for unsupervised grouping of data.

Each algorithm is tested on a sample dataset, and the project includes performance evaluation and visualization.
